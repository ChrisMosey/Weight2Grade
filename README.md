# Weight2Grade
Weight2Grade is an HTML5 app for students to easily assess how well they are performing at school by 
setting targets and calculating grades. It works by collecting all the weighted tasks of a class, and after 
recieving marks from the student it displays the achieved and lost weight in an easy to understand way.

Students can use Weight2Grade to keep track of assignments and due-dates, as well as calculate how well
they need to perform in exams to achieve a specific mark. They can enter all their entire syllabus at once,
or task by task.
